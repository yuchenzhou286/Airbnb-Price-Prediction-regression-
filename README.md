Airbnb has been a trending product that people use to book living and it is a good substitute of other hotel booking websites.

This dataset including the Chicago airbnb information about the hosts, the information about the position of the Airbnb( neighborhood, latitude, longitude) which can use for map plot, describe of the room, and price, etc. Which will be a good dataset for data visualization and prediction. This public dataset is part of Airbnb, and the original source can be found from Airbnb Open Data.

The main question I want to explore in this project: What factors influence the price and which model performs the best in price prediction?
