### MACS-33002 "Introduction to Machine Learning" Individual Project

Due on May 28th Saturday 11:00 pm.

Please push your Jupyter notebook and your slides to your GitHub classroom (here), name it as **33002_P1_YourLastFirstName**.

Please record your presentation and upload the shared **link** to your recording here:

----------------------


Here are the **detailed instructions** for creating your presentation (previously posted on Ed):

Please organize your presentation from following four aspects (task, data, model, result). Try to summarize each point in a clear and logical way (in technical presentation, smooth logic is the most important thing), try to make your presentation short (6min limit) and to the point.

- **Task**:
	- summarize your task in less than 3 sentences
	- is it classification (binary or multi-class) or regression?
- **Data**:
	- What does your data looks like? (e.g., show your dataframe)
	- What's the data size? Is there any missing value? How do you deal with missing values?
	- If it's classification, what is the class distribution (e.g., how many samples in each class, if it's unbalanced, how do you deal with that) If it's regression, what is the regression value distribution (e.g., histogram of the values)?
	- What's your feature space? How many features? What type of features? (e.g., 10 features in total, 8 numerical, 2 categorical)
	- What data preprocessing steps you have done? (e.g., encoding for categorical features, scaling for numerical features, vectorize text features)
	- How do you get training and testing set? 
- **Model**:
	- Which model(s) did you use?
	- For each model, which parameter setting do you apply (if you are not using the default value)?
	- What is the model performance? (e.g., show the score or classification report)
- **Result analysis**:
	- Interpret the model performance (e.g., top coefficient features for each class, or what does the decision tree looks like)
	- Show examples where the classifier fails (e.g., the test samples that the classifier make wrong predictions)
	- Error analysis: explain where do you think the errors come from and why? Do you have any possible solution to improve the model performance?

Please remember that: 
- try to summarize each point in a clear and logical way (in technical presentation, smooth logic is the most important thing)
- try to make your presentation short and to the point, and avoid the wordy way
